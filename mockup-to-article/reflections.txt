You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

1) What new skills have you learned?
	I've already had a good experience with HTML, so i've learned not too much of new things. For example, using tag <s> for striking (which i used to do olny with CSS text-decoration property before). Also, i learned how to use Chrome Front End Feedback extension to test my code.

2) What has been easy?
	Understanding the tree model, finding bugs in basic html layout.

3) What has been difficult?
	I've recently started practicing Vim instead of Sublime, so it was sometimes tricky to make a simple copy&paste and other standart text operations.

4) How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?	
	I visited MDN and other recources like Stackoverflow to find answers for my questions, as i usually do.
